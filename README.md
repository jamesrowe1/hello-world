About Me

I'm 32, Male from Sydney, Australia. I enjoy hiking, discovering new restaurants, and swimming. I also like tennis, but consider myself an sbolute beginner (at best) when it comes to hitting the ball. I intend on sharpening up my skills on the court to play social tennis with friends and family.
